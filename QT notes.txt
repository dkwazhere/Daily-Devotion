	Human's these days have an immediate NEED and WANT for things.
These passages divert all their attention from themselves to God.
vs 13 begins with - you will arise and have pity on zion, it is time to favor her, the appointed time as come.
Zion refers to kingdom of God that will established on the future time. 
vs 18 - Let these words be recorded for a generation to come.
vs 13-17 talks about a future matter.
vs 20 - the lord will hear from heaven and look down at earth and hear the groans of the prisoners and set free of thoes are to die.
	-talks about the eternal restoration.

Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is death.

vs 23-28 - Talking about the temporal nature of that we will Die, vs 27-28 talks about God's eternal purposes.
	-everything will perish but God you are the same your years have no end.
	-the children of your servents will grow secure their offspring will be established for you.
	
	
- when we look at this all together - we see the psalms is struggling with some sort of distress, that the prisoners are doomed to die.
but GOd has a plan for us to eternally live with him through JEsus Christ. The writer finds peace that God will continue to show us his faith in us through all generations.

God is faithful in the past, faithful today, and faithful in the future.

In the immediate situation things may seem desperate but the writer looks at eternity he see's a bigger and better fufillment.
God is the same and his years have no end. God has a plan set in motion and we must find comfort in that.

#3. 
	Today's psalm talks about reminding his soul to bless the Lord.
The pslams begin with blessed the Lord with all my soul. 
Bless means kneeling, idea of blessing is reconognizing God is at upmost value, he is due respect and reverence.
Kneeling is an act of submission.
Vs 2 - he gives a reason, blessed the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefit.(lets not forget what God has done for us).
vs 3 - 5: Psalms is describing God's mercy. (Let us not forget). - not forget God's mercy.
 
We tend to forget what God has done and tend to worship other things in our lives, instead of God.
Just how Isreal turned from God and said "God we dont need you anymore" - started to worship other things. - Book of Hosea. (Isreal is like a promiscious women who has turned from God).

God encourages us to constantly remember God's Faithfulness, because once we forget we turn to our needs and worship other things in life.
Deutoronmy 6 - says God will give Isreal what they did not earn and what they do not deserve.
	if you are not faithful there will be consequences.-consequences for your unfaithfulness (the anger of God will burn the judgement of God will burn for all sin.)

vs 9 - says he will not always punish us and nor will he keep his anger forever. (what this means is There will be a season where God will pour his anger due to unrighteousness.
because, God cannot be unrighteousness. 
God cannot walk along side with people who sin. - therefore his judgement will be poured out.

God is on a mission to restore his people. The only way to do it is for some person is to recieve all the wrath on our behalf.
The only way God solves this rebellion is by sending his son Jesus.
Jesus is the one taht takes the wrath on our behalf.

VS 12 - He removed our sins as far as the east from the west. He does this by sending his son Jesus Christ.

Lets reflect on Jesus, who paid the price for our sins.

If you're feeling God is distant thats the best time to run to him, you may find that running to God in worship you will discover that he is always there!
I encourage us throughout the day that we keep our eyes focused on him to see and to walk with the Lord.

#4. Psalms 103:13-22
Today's passage is about Thanksgiving. We should continue to remember to give thanks to the Lord.
In vs 1. of 103: David is praying to God from his inner most soul / his heart to not forget and praise God.
He is in a way preaching to himself, preaching the gospel that he should never forget.

vs 13 - As a father he does not approach us on what we do right or wrong. He is a father who has compassion.
vs 14 - He is a father who knows how we are formed and how we were made of dust.
	- He knows our true intentions, he understands, he can see right through us.
vs 17 - everlasting to everlasting the Lord's love is with those who fear him.
	- He loves you, and he knows your situation and he is WITH YOU to strengthen you.
	- Think of a mother's love or father's love. Unconditional love. God has that but more.
vs 20-21 - When we trust and recieve God's word. If we obey and listen and walk with God then we will see what God enables and powers us to, and see how God will change our lives.

How can you remind yourself everyday of God's unchanging love?
- As we continue to obey and follow him we will begin to see his love his power strengthening our lives, and making our lives stable and consistent.
- Thank the Lord, as we walk with him throughout our day.
