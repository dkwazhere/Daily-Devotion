	Human's these days have an immediate NEED and WANT for things.
These passages divert all their attention from themselves to God.
vs 13 begins with - you will arise and have pity on zion, it is time to favor her, the appointed time as come.
Zion refers to kingdom of God that will established on the future time. 
vs 18 - Let these words be recorded for a generation to come.
vs 13-17 talks about a future matter.
vs 20 - the lord will hear from heaven and look down at earth and hear the groans of the prisoners and set free of thoes are to die.
	-talks about the eternal restoration.

Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is death.

vs 23-28 - Talking about the temporal nature of that we will Die, vs 27-28 talks about God's eternal purposes.
	-everything will perish but God you are the same your years have no end.
	-the children of your servents will grow secure their offspring will be established for you.
	
	
- when we look at this all together - we see the psalms is struggling with some sort of distress, that the prisoners are doomed to die.
but GOd has a plan for us to eternally live with him through JEsus Christ. The writer finds peace that God will continue to show us his faith in us through all generations.

God is faithful in the past, faithful today, and faithful in the future.

In the immediate situation things may seem desperate but the writer looks at eternity he see's a bigger and better fufillment.
God is the same and his years have no end. God has a plan set in motion and we must find comfort in that.

"Any philosophy which deals with the here and now is not adequate for man" - Billy Graham.

#3. 
	Today's psalm talks about reminding his soul to bless the Lord.
The pslams begin with blessed the Lord with all my soul. 
Bless means kneeling, idea of blessing is reconognizing God is at upmost value, he is due respect and reverence.
Kneeling is an act of submission.
Vs 2 - he gives a reason, blessed the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefit.(lets not forget what God has done for us).
vs 3 - 5: Psalms is describing God's mercy. (Let us not forget). - not forget God's mercy.
 
We tend to forget what God has done and tend to worship other things in our lives, instead of God.
Just how Isreal turned from God and said "God we dont need you anymore" - started to worship other things. - Book of Hosea. (Isreal is like a promiscious women who has turned from God).

God encourages us to constantly remember God's Faithfulness, because once we forget we turn to our needs and worship other things in life.
Deutoronmy 6 - says God will give Isreal what they did not earn and what they do not deserve.
	if you are not faithful there will be consequences.-consequences for your unfaithfulness (the anger of God will burn the judgement of God will burn for all sin.)

vs 9 - says he will not always punish us and nor will he keep his anger forever. (what this means is There will be a season where God will pour his anger due to unrighteousness.
because, God cannot be unrighteousness. 
God cannot walk along side with people who sin. - therefore his judgement will be poured out.

God is on a mission to restore his people. The only way to do it is for some person is to recieve all the wrath on our behalf.
The only way God solves this rebellion is by sending his son Jesus.
Jesus is the one taht takes the wrath on our behalf.

VS 12 - He removed our sins as far as the east from the west. He does this by sending his son Jesus Christ.

Lets reflect on Jesus, who paid the price for our sins.

If you're feeling God is distant thats the best time to run to him, you may find that running to God in worship you will discover that he is always there!
I encourage us throughout the day that we keep our eyes focused on him to see and to walk with the Lord.

#4. Psalms 103:13-22
Today's passage is about Thanksgiving. We should continue to remember to give thanks to the Lord.
In vs 1. of 103: David is praying to God from his inner most soul / his heart to not forget and praise God.
He is in a way preaching to himself, preaching the gospel that he should never forget.

vs 13 - As a father he does not approach us on what we do right or wrong. He is a father who has compassion.
vs 14 - He is a father who knows how we are formed and how we were made of dust.
	- He knows our true intentions, he understands, he can see right through us.
vs 17 - everlasting to everlasting the Lord's love is with those who fear him.
	- He loves you, and he knows your situation and he is WITH YOU to strengthen you.
	- Think of a mother's love or father's love. Unconditional love. God has that but more.
vs 20-21 - When we trust and recieve God's word. If we obey and listen and walk with God then we will see what God enables and powers us to, and see how God will change our lives.

How can you remind yourself everyday of God's unchanging love?
- As we continue to obey and follow him we will begin to see his love his power strengthening our lives, and making our lives stable and consistent.
- Thank the Lord, as we walk with him throughout our day.

#5 Psalms 104: 1-18;
God is creator who created us and sustains us.
The main theme for these verses is that God is creator, and he is sustainer.
What we see is his 6 day's of creation and how he did it and what he did.
Vs 1 - starts off with praise the Lord O my soul, you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
In Hebrew Praise the Lord means "Bless the Lord".
How are we to bless the Lord? When we give thanks to him and come before him we are blessed.
	-Those hearts, and words, and response of gratitute and worship those are the ways we Bless the Lord, because it please him
	and makes him Happy.
** REMEMBER to Bless the Lord - reconognize him and thank the Lord.
vs 14 - he makes the grass for the cattle, plants for us to cultivate.
	-God is blessing us with everything he's created, he sustains us.

How can i inspire others to be thankful for God's care and provision?
	-Our God is God who created, and also he sustains. He is in control and he is soverign.
	vs 9 - he set a boundary. 
		- He knows whats going on and sets boundaries, he is in CONTROL. we must put our faith and trust in him.


"It is a happy world after all. The air, the earth, the water teem with delighted existence". -William Paley.

#6 Psalms 104: 19-35.
Giving thanks opens your eyes to see more and more things we are blessed with.
If we do not give thanks we darken our eyes. We see less and less.
So we must learn to give thanks so we can see what God has done to bless us, we also see his presence and his heart by giving thanks.
Yesterday we talked about creation, how he made us and worked on us. He created us for others to be a blessing.
vs 19 - He put order and rythym in the system. He has total control of when.
God put a system for everyone and everything to rest and go.
People are farmers and we need to take rest and go home before we come out, plants and animals all have their own way in the system.
Why Worry so much when God will provide for us, we should be encouraged and reminded that God knows us and we should place our hearts and trust in him.
vs 28 - when He gives to them they gather, when you open your hands we are satisfied with good things.
vs 29 - God provides next generations after our generations. God is sustaining his creation and carrying out his creation.
vs 31 - Give God glory because we see his glory as we see his handy work.
vs 31 and down reminds us to see his Glory, see his majesty, sing to him, give thanks to him, praise him!
vs 34 - May my meditation be pleasing to him as we bless the Lord!

prase the Lord, and bless the Lord today!

How can you praise God today for the amazing order and design in creation?
	-Take time and look around and see how God has created so many things around us.
	-Look carefully at how God created people and how he's working in their lives.
	-Thank God for his creation, but also thank God for the people God has put in our lives.
	-Thank the Lord for his qualities and characters he has.

#7. Psalms 105: 1-15
Today we will focus on making God known.
We want to develop and interavtive relationship with Jesus Christ.
Not just a personal opinon but really get to know him and make him Known!
Vs 1-5 - Verbs such as give praise to the Lord, Make known what he has done, sing to him, tell of his wonderful acts, glory in his holy name, rejoice, remember what he has done.
	-We are encouraged to make God known.
In psalms 105 we see how God has been faithful to his people (History of God).
We should look back at our own lives and see how God has been faithful.
We should consider how God has been faithful to me and to his people may us remember this and share it with others for God's glory and our joy

What wonderful acts has God done for you?

How can we show that we actually know God?
- one of those ways is through prayer.

"Everything you do affects those you love. ALl of life is covenant" - Paul E. Miller.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#8. Psalms 105: 16-36
Today we are considering how God worked through history and how he has been faithful.
As we look into this great historical psalms we should thank God for his faithfulness and for future faithfulness.
We read how God has revealed himself in history, we start with abraham, isaac, jacob, and now we come to joseph.
There was a time where Joseph went to egypt and he used him to help his people in egypt. there was a gap in time where there was a lot of waiting, because people became slaves.
That is when God brings fourth Moses.
No eye has seen Nor ear has heard of a God besides thee, who works for those who wait for him...
We have a God who works for us, he gives us faith and will help us produce fruit within our lives.
He does so as we wait for him (as we trust him, and be obedient to him.)
Vs 26 - He sent Moses his servent, whom he chose
Psalm 105 doesnt tell us how he sent him but in Exodus shows us.
God says he will be with us in the present and that he will be with us in the future.
We should be thankful that God is truly present. That he is with us, be thankful for who God is.
He wants to work through us and within us.

What testimonies can you share from your life with those who are doubting the faithfulness of God?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#9. Psalms 105: 37-45
As we read these verses ... We are reminded that God's people are a chosen people.
As we look at this psalms we should be remembered what God has done throughout history.
God is saying I am your God, and you are my people.
We should say Yes! You are our God, and we are your people! -Saying this studying it, should produce a thankful heart within us.
We are called to live as God's people.

As we look at this historical and great Psalms, we are reminded God is the one that brought his people out of Egypt out of slavery.
He provided for his people and sustained them, even at the time of wilderness.
At Psalms 46: God is our refuge and strength..... God speaks, Be still and know that "I am God"..... I will be exalted among the nations, and the earth.
we should cease driving, let go, and relax.
Know that God is God, think of how God has sustained his people in the wilderness as they entered the promise land.
We can see God has been with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and how he used Moses to bring his people out of Egypt, out of slavery.
Vs 40 - They asked and he brought them quail, he fed them well with the bread of heaven.
	-He sent mana! day after day!
	-God miraculously fed them and provided for them.
Jesus in the new testament says "I am the bread of life"
	-Jesus provides for us and sustains us.
Vs 41 - God opened the rock, and water gushed out, it flowed like a river in the desert.
	-God was even providing water through a rock....
	-When we turn to Jesus, he says he is the living water, he said this to the woman at the well.

We dont always follow God's will.. 
Vs 45 - All of this was so we keep his precepts and observe his laws.
When we turn away from God, we are only provided broken, yucky water that will never satisfy.
I encourage you....Today, we should stay focused and stay close to the Lord, He is the bread of life, he is the fountain of living water. He wants to give us that kind of life.
so lets taste and see that the Lord is good.

How can you be better at obeying God's word and walking in his ways as a part of God's chosen people?
-We should bless the Lord as we consider how he's been faithful to us.
We can say Blessed be the Lord!, Blessed be the Lord who has been faithful and was with those in the bible.
We should Bless the Lord as he has been with us, and will be with us along the way.

"May God give us a fresh realization of the overwhelming abundance He provides. Indeed, our cup overflows" - Charles Swindoll.

10. Psalms 106: 1-12
Hang in there... God is going to be the strength to hang in there...
We're going to see Israel struggle to hang in there.
Vs 4 - is a call upon God. The psalmist needs help from the Lord
vs 5 - The idea of coming together to be united in this praise.
vs 6 - We're not all that we think we are, we have sinned
vs 7 - Our ancestors gave no thought to your miracles.
	- We dont acknowledge what God has done.
vs 8 - Yet he saved them for his name sake, to make his mighty powers known.
	-Why did God save me? What did he see in me?
	-Apostle Paul's life was changed dramatically - he was saved to go and save the Gentiles.
	-Paul would be the messenger the giver of good news.
	-Those who known paul, his hostility towards Christians, People will reconognize how great God is by changing those who werent changeable.
Did God save me that i my witness to others? like the apostle Paul?
There are groups that we are to impact/witness.
Jesus saved me so that I am to reach someone to bear witness. Who is it that I need to reach?

How can you keep your eyes fixed on God so that you do not repeat your past mistakes?
-Israel was saved to show the mighty works of God, Paul was saved to reach out to the Gentiles, those who were outside the household of God.
-Who will we encounter today? Who will we see this week, To witness and share with them
-We were saved YES, We were encouraged by God yes... But not for our own benefit, but for others, family, coworker, friends, etc
-I pray that I open my eyes to see who it is.

11. Failure and Rebellion (Psalms 106: 12-33)
Today as we look at psalms 106 we will see how israel responded to God's hand.
What is it we sometimes forget what God has done?
Sometimes we get ahead of God and we dont wait for him. (Backslider = someone who goes with the Lord and they backslide)
Some people are front sliders, they get ahead of God and say cmon God, lets go here, lets go there.
The Israelites did just that, they didn't wait for the Lord.
We need to wait for God's plan and let it unfold.
God knows whats best for me and he in time will provide that.
vs 20 - They exchanged their Glorious God for an image of a bull which eats grass... 
	-What do I substitute with God? Where do I go to when trouble comes?
	-Where do I go for my comfort? WHO do I substitute God for?
God wants us to fully follow him and dont put a substitute.

Confess the areas you struggle to honor and obey God to the Lord and surrender your whole life to Him.
vs 24 - Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promises.
	Today the substitutes will harm people and lead them down a bad path. We should encourage people that God is at work at our Lives.
	God can comfort us and solve the problems we have today.

"When you surrender to Christ, you surrender to chaos" - Tony Evans.

12. Despite their Rebellion (Psalms 106: 34-48)
Christ has broken the barrier, that we can become one. Gentile and Israelites
Today as we look at Psalms 106, we see how the israelites wanted to join with someone other than God's will.
	- They didnt want to commit to their relationship with God.
Vs 34 - 35 - God doesnt want to share us with other idols/other Gods/other Ideas.
	- "Mingled" means to become part of and to interact with it.
Vs 41 - He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes rules over them.
	- They become a slave to them.
We as people like to mingle with others/and things that God despises.
Vs 43 - The Lord delivers them, he draws them back, God is jealous and he wants us to himself.
	- He has the best in mind for us.
	- But they were rebelled and were brought low for their iniquity.
vs 46 - He caused them all who were captive to show them mercy
	- God is going to show us mercy to those who are causing us to be in bondage.
We should avoid mingling and ask God to guide us.

Why are you thankful for God's mercy and love?
	-God has a process and work in our lives. (Sanctification)
	-Drawing us away and setting us apart for his work.
	-As we look at our lives are we set apart? are we different from the world?
	-Christ came as a revolutionary, he came in rebellion to the world's system.
	-He wants it to be different, for us we need to live differently.
	-We should go against the grain, against the flow of the world.
	
"To trust in his power and faithfulness, to obey his authority, to delight in his will and grace, to love him above all, because of his excellencies and beauty; this is to glorify him". -John Owen.

13. Solomon is King (2 Chronicles 1:1-17)

The story is focused on Solomon, he joined his people and actually led them to worship.
He couldve been like another king, but he worshipped with his people.
God offered Solomon anything in this world - Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge.
God gave him that and also gave him wealth as well.
Solomon could've asked for power and fame, but Solomon's heart was aligned with God's heart.
	- To look after God's people.
	- The heart of a servent Solomon had.
	- God was so pleased that he granted him more than what he asked.
There is a greater King, named Jesus Christ.
	- He gave his kingdom in heaven to come to the world and die for our sins.
	- He made himself nothing, he came as a man.
	- Jesus didnt use his power and glory for himself, he loved us so much that he lowered himself as a man and died on a cross for us.

If you see selfish tendencies in your heart, how can you realign your desires to match with God's?
	- What do we want most in life?
	- Is it focused on us? Our comfort? Our ambitions.
	- We should give everything up to God and let him take the wheel.
	- Will we use the gifts we receive to ourselves? or help others when we receive the gifts from God.

"Wisdom and love are often quiet. Deception puts on a big show". -Donald Miller.
