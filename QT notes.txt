	Human's these days have an immediate NEED and WANT for things.
These passages divert all their attention from themselves to God.
vs 13 begins with - you will arise and have pity on zion, it is time to favor her, the appointed time as come.
Zion refers to kingdom of God that will established on the future time. 
vs 18 - Let these words be recorded for a generation to come.
vs 13-17 talks about a future matter.
vs 20 - the lord will hear from heaven and look down at earth and hear the groans of the prisoners and set free of thoes are to die.
	-talks about the eternal restoration.

Romans 6:23 says that the wages of sin is death.

vs 23-28 - Talking about the temporal nature of that we will Die, vs 27-28 talks about God's eternal purposes.
	-everything will perish but God you are the same your years have no end.
	-the children of your servents will grow secure their offspring will be established for you.
	
	
- when we look at this all together - we see the psalms is struggling with some sort of distress, that the prisoners are doomed to die.
but GOd has a plan for us to eternally live with him through JEsus Christ. The writer finds peace that God will continue to show us his faith in us through all generations.

God is faithful in the past, faithful today, and faithful in the future.

In the immediate situation things may seem desperate but the writer looks at eternity he see's a bigger and better fufillment.
God is the same and his years have no end. God has a plan set in motion and we must find comfort in that.

	Today's psalm talks about reminding his soul to bless the Lord.
The pslams begin with blessed the Lord with all my soul. 
Bless means kneeling, idea of blessing is reconognizing God is at upmost value, he is due respect and reverence.
Kneeling is an act of submission.
Vs 2 - he gives a reason, blessed the Lord all my soul and forget not all his benefit.(lets not forget what God has done for us).
vs 3 - 5: Psalms is describing God's mercy. (Let us not forget). - not forget God's mercy.
 
We tend to forget what God has done and tend to worship other things in our lives, instead of God.
Just how Isreal turned from God and said "God we dont need you anymore" - started to worship other things. - Book of Hosea. (Isreal is like a promiscious women who has turned from God).

God encourages us to constantly remember God's Faithfulness, because once we forget we turn to our needs and worship other things in life.
Deutoronmy 6 - says God will give Isreal what they did not earn and what they do not deserve.
	if you are not faithful there will be consequences.-consequences for your unfaithfulness (the anger of God will burn the judgement of God will burn for all sin.)

vs 9 - says he will not always punish us and nor will he keep his anger forever. (what this means is There will be a season where God will pour his anger due to unrighteousness.
because, God cannot be unrighteousness. 
God cannot walk along side with people who sin. - therefore his judgement will be poured out.

God is on a mission to restore his people. The only way to do it is for some person is to recieve all the wrath on our behalf.
The only way God solves this rebellion is by sending his son Jesus.
Jesus is the one taht takes the wrath on our behalf.

VS 12 - He removed our sins as far as the east from the west. He does this by sending his son Jesus Christ.

Lets reflect on Jesus, who paid the price for our sins.

If you're feeling God is distant thats the best time to run to him, you may find that running to God in worship you will discover that he is always there!
I encourage us throughout the day that we keep our eyes focused on him to see and to walk with the Lord.

#4. Psalms 103:13-22
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181017

Today's passage is about Thanksgiving. We should continue to remember to give thanks to the Lord.
In vs 1. of 103: David is praying to God from his inner most soul / his heart to not forget and praise God.
He is in a way preaching to himself, preaching the gospel that he should never forget.

vs 13 - As a father he does not approach us on what we do right or wrong. He is a father who has compassion.
vs 14 - He is a father who knows how we are formed and how we were made of dust.
	- He knows our true intentions, he understands, he can see right through us.
vs 17 - everlasting to everlasting the Lord's love is with those who fear him.
	- He loves you, and he knows your situation and he is WITH YOU to strengthen you.
	- Think of a mother's love or father's love. Unconditional love. God has that but more.
vs 20-21 - When we trust and recieve God's word. If we obey and listen and walk with God then we will see what God enables and powers us to, and see how God will change our lives.

How can you remind yourself everyday of God's unchanging love?
- As we continue to obey and follow him we will begin to see his love his power strengthening our lives, and making our lives stable and consistent.
- Thank the Lord, as we walk with him throughout our day.

#5 Psalms 104: 1-18;
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181018

God is creator who created us and sustains us.
The main theme for these verses is that God is creator, and he is sustainer.
What we see is his 6 day's of creation and how he did it and what he did.
Vs 1 - starts off with praise the Lord O my soul, you are clothed with splendor and majesty.
In Hebrew Praise the Lord means "Bless the Lord".
How are we to bless the Lord? When we give thanks to him and come before him we are blessed.
	-Those hearts, and words, and response of gratitute and worship those are the ways we Bless the Lord, because it please him
	and makes him Happy.
** REMEMBER to Bless the Lord - reconognize him and thank the Lord.
vs 14 - he makes the grass for the cattle, plants for us to cultivate.
	-God is blessing us with everything he's created, he sustains us.

How can i inspire others to be thankful for God's care and provision?
	-Our God is God who created, and also he sustains. He is in control and he is soverign.
	vs 9 - he set a boundary. 
		- He knows whats going on and sets boundaries, he is in CONTROL. we must put our faith and trust in him.

#6 Psalms 104: 19-35.
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181019
Giving thanks opens your eyes to see more and more things we are blessed with.
If we do not give thanks we darken our eyes. We see less and less.
So we must learn to give thanks so we can see what God has done to bless us, we also see his presence and his heart by giving thanks.
Yesterday we talked about creation, how he made us and worked on us. He created us for others to be a blessing.
vs 19 - He put order and rythym in the system. He has total control of when.
God put a system for everyone and everything to rest and go.
People are farmers and we need to take rest and go home before we come out, plants and animals all have their own way in the system.
Why Worry so much when God will provide for us, we should be encouraged and reminded that God knows us and we should place our hearts and trust in him.
vs 28 - when He gives to them they gather, when you open your hands we are satisfied with good things.
vs 29 - God provides next generations after our generations. God is sustaining his creation and carrying out his creation.
vs 31 - Give God glory because we see his glory as we see his handy work.
vs 31 and down reminds us to see his Glory, see his majesty, sing to him, give thanks to him, praise him!
vs 34 - May my meditation be pleasing to him as we bless the Lord!

prase the Lord, and bless the Lord today!

How can you praise God today for the amazing order and design in creation?
	-Take time and look around and see how God has created so many things around us.
	-Look carefully at how God created people and how he's working in their lives.
	-Thank God for his creation, but also thank God for the people God has put in our lives.
	-Thank the Lord for his qualities and characters he has.

#7. Psalms 105: 1-15
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181020

Today we will focus on making God known.
We want to develop and interavtive relationship with Jesus Christ.
Not just a personal opinon but really get to know him and make him Known!
Vs 1-5 - Verbs such as give praise to the Lord, Make known what he has done, sing to him, tell of his wonderful acts, glory in his holy name, rejoice, remember what he has done.
	-We are encouraged to make God known.
In psalms 105 we see how God has been faithful to his people (History of God).
We should look back at our own lives and see how God has been faithful.
We should consider how God has been faithful to me and to his people may us remember this and share it with others for God's glory and our joy

What wonderful acts has God done for you?

How can we show that we actually know God?
- one of those ways is through prayer.

#8. Psalms 105: 16-36
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181021

Today we are considering how God worked through history and how he has been faithful.
As we look into this great historical psalms we should thank God for his faithfulness and for future faithfulness.
We read how God has revealed himself in history, we start with abraham, isaac, jacob, and now we come to joseph.
There was a time where Joseph went to egypt and he used him to help his people in egypt. there was a gap in time where there was a lot of waiting, because people became slaves.
That is when God brings fourth Moses.
No eye has seen Nor ear has heard of a God besides thee, who works for those who wait for him...
We have a God who works for us, he gives us faith and will help us produce fruit within our lives.
He does so as we wait for him (as we trust him, and be obedient to him.)
Vs 26 - He sent Moses his servent, whom he chose
Psalm 105 doesnt tell us how he sent him but in Exodus shows us.
God says he will be with us in the present and that he will be with us in the future.
We should be thankful that God is truly present. That he is with us, be thankful for who God is.
He wants to work through us and within us.

What testimonies can you share from your life with those who are doubting the faithfulness of God?

#9. Psalms 105: 37-45
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181022

As we read these verses ... We are reminded that God's people are a chosen people.
As we look at this psalms we should be remembered what God has done throughout history.
God is saying I am your God, and you are my people.
We should say Yes! You are our God, and we are your people! -Saying this studying it, should produce a thankful heart within us.
We are called to live as God's people.

As we look at this historical and great Psalms, we are reminded God is the one that brought his people out of Egypt out of slavery.
He provided for his people and sustained them, even at the time of wilderness.
At Psalms 46: God is our refuge and strength..... God speaks, Be still and know that "I am God"..... I will be exalted among the nations, and the earth.
we should cease driving, let go, and relax.
Know that God is God, think of how God has sustained his people in the wilderness as they entered the promise land.
We can see God has been with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and Joseph, and how he used Moses to bring his people out of Egypt, out of slavery.
Vs 40 - They asked and he brought them quail, he fed them well with the bread of heaven.
	-He sent mana! day after day!
	-God miraculously fed them and provided for them.
Jesus in the new testament says "I am the bread of life"
	-Jesus provides for us and sustains us.
Vs 41 - God opened the rock, and water gushed out, it flowed like a river in the desert.
	-God was even providing water through a rock....
	-When we turn to Jesus, he says he is the living water, he said this to the woman at the well.

We dont always follow God's will.. 
Vs 45 - All of this was so we keep his precepts and observe his laws.
When we turn away from God, we are only provided broken, yucky water that will never satisfy.
I encourage you....Today, we should stay focused and stay close to the Lord, He is the bread of life, he is the fountain of living water. He wants to give us that kind of life.
so lets taste and see that the Lord is good.

How can you be better at obeying God's word and walking in his ways as a part of God's chosen people?
-We should bless the Lord as we consider how he's been faithful to us.
We can say Blessed be the Lord!, Blessed be the Lord who has been faithful and was with those in the bible.
We should Bless the Lord as he has been with us, and will be with us along the way.

"May God give us a fresh realization of the overwhelming abundance He provides. Indeed, our cup overflows" - Charles Swindoll.

10. Psalms 106: 1-12
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181023

Hang in there... God is going to be the strength to hang in there...
We're going to see Israel struggle to hang in there.
Vs 4 - is a call upon God. The psalmist needs help from the Lord
vs 5 - The idea of coming together to be united in this praise.
vs 6 - We're not all that we think we are, we have sinned
vs 7 - Our ancestors gave no thought to your miracles.
	- We dont acknowledge what God has done.
vs 8 - Yet he saved them for his name sake, to make his mighty powers known.
	-Why did God save me? What did he see in me?
	-Apostle Paul's life was changed dramatically - he was saved to go and save the Gentiles.
	-Paul would be the messenger the giver of good news.
	-Those who known paul, his hostility towards Christians, People will reconognize how great God is by changing those who werent changeable.
Did God save me that i my witness to others? like the apostle Paul?
There are groups that we are to impact/witness.
Jesus saved me so that I am to reach someone to bear witness. Who is it that I need to reach?

How can you keep your eyes fixed on God so that you do not repeat your past mistakes?
-Israel was saved to show the mighty works of God, Paul was saved to reach out to the Gentiles, those who were outside the household of God.
-Who will we encounter today? Who will we see this week, To witness and share with them
-We were saved YES, We were encouraged by God yes... But not for our own benefit, but for others, family, coworker, friends, etc
-I pray that I open my eyes to see who it is.

11. Failure and Rebellion (Psalms 106: 12-33)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181024

Today as we look at psalms 106 we will see how israel responded to God's hand.
What is it we sometimes forget what God has done?
Sometimes we get ahead of God and we dont wait for him. (Backslider = someone who goes with the Lord and they backslide)
Some people are front sliders, they get ahead of God and say cmon God, lets go here, lets go there.
The Israelites did just that, they didn't wait for the Lord.
We need to wait for God's plan and let it unfold.
God knows whats best for me and he in time will provide that.
vs 20 - They exchanged their Glorious God for an image of a bull which eats grass... 
	-What do I substitute with God? Where do I go to when trouble comes?
	-Where do I go for my comfort? WHO do I substitute God for?
God wants us to fully follow him and dont put a substitute.

Confess the areas you struggle to honor and obey God to the Lord and surrender your whole life to Him.
vs 24 - Then they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his promises.
	Today the substitutes will harm people and lead them down a bad path. We should encourage people that God is at work at our Lives.
	God can comfort us and solve the problems we have today.

"When you surrender to Christ, you surrender to chaos" - Tony Evans.

12. Despite their Rebellion (Psalms 106: 34-48)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181025

Christ has broken the barrier, that we can become one. Gentile and Israelites
Today as we look at Psalms 106, we see how the israelites wanted to join with someone other than God's will.
	- They didnt want to commit to their relationship with God.
Vs 34 - 35 - God doesnt want to share us with other idols/other Gods/other Ideas.
	- "Mingled" means to become part of and to interact with it.
Vs 41 - He gave them into the hands of the nations, and their foes rules over them.
	- They become a slave to them.
We as people like to mingle with others/and things that God despises.
Vs 43 - The Lord delivers them, he draws them back, God is jealous and he wants us to himself.
	- He has the best in mind for us.
	- But they were rebelled and were brought low for their iniquity.
vs 46 - He caused them all who were captive to show them mercy
	- God is going to show us mercy to those who are causing us to be in bondage.
We should avoid mingling and ask God to guide us.

Why are you thankful for God's mercy and love?
	-God has a process and work in our lives. (Sanctification)
	-Drawing us away and setting us apart for his work.
	-As we look at our lives are we set apart? are we different from the world?
	-Christ came as a revolutionary, he came in rebellion to the world's system.
	-He wants it to be different, for us we need to live differently.
	-We should go against the grain, against the flow of the world.

13. Solomon is King (2 Chronicles 1:1-17)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181026

The story is focused on Solomon, he joined his people and actually led them to worship.
He couldve been like another king, but he worshipped with his people.
God offered Solomon anything in this world - Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge.
God gave him that and also gave him wealth as well.
Solomon could've asked for power and fame, but Solomon's heart was aligned with God's heart.
	- To look after God's people.
	- The heart of a servent Solomon had.
	- God was so pleased that he granted him more than what he asked.
There is a greater King, named Jesus Christ.
	- He gave his kingdom in heaven to come to the world and die for our sins.
	- He made himself nothing, he came as a man.
	- Jesus didnt use his power and glory for himself, he loved us so much that he lowered himself as a man and died on a cross for us.

If you see selfish tendencies in your heart, how can you realign your desires to match with God's?
	- What do we want most in life?
	- Is it focused on us? Our comfort? Our ambitions.
	- We should give everything up to God and let him take the wheel.
	- Will we use the gifts we receive to ourselves? or help others when we receive the gifts from God.

"Wisdom and love are often quiet. Deception puts on a big show". -Donald Miller.

14. Preparing to Build (2 Chronicles 2:1-10)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181027

Filled with wisdom, Solomon issued his decree to prepare to build a temple.
Solomon explains The purpose of the temple is to lay out incense, to layour concecrated bread, and to lay out sacrifice.
We should bodly proclaim God's greatness to others around us.
He uses recruits many workers to build the temple.
As Christians God calls us with unique skillsets. When we are alone it's hard to fullfill something but when we are all together we can fullfill much.
We are one body in Christ. Let us use our skills to serve him.
Each one of us God has placed a skill for us that is different from us.
God has saved us, that we join all creation to reflect his glory and grace.
Alot of pastors burnout, pastor's try to do everything themselves, over time as the energy depletes, creativity loses, ability to God's word and share diminishes, sense of patiences goes away.
	- The one's with gifts should be made room so they can teach/serve.
God gives each of us a skillset, as a part to contribute to the whole.

What talents and resources are you using to further God's kingdom?

"Ever since I became a Christian I have thought that the best, perhaps, the only service I could do for my unbelieving nehbours was to explain and defend the belief that has been common to nearly all Christians at all times". - C.S Lewis

15. Help from Afar (2 Chronicles 2:11-18)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181028

Solomon teamed up with a Pagan king named Hiram.
David worked with Hiram, to build a temple, but God said No because David was a warrior and had killed thousands of men.
So David promised God that Solomon would make the temple.
Hiram was able to offer stonecutters, metalworkers, fabricators, even artists, Solomon in turn would provide thousands of laborers.
Hiram knew a good business deal when he saw one. But Hiram sent his best supervisor and provided Solomon with everything he asked for.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel - Hiram said. Hiram is not a Hebrew. Hiram may have been converted..
Hiram is a reminder that God's people cannot be smug. God moves in mysterious ways.
Hiram of Tyre, the pagan foreigner.
God uses unbelievers.

What are some circumstances in your life that God can use for his kingdom?

As Christians we know the world is watching us, they're searching for truth as well.
Keep our eyes open for person's of peace.
Jesus called Saul, a persecutor of Christians.
God can use anyone, the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few.
We must not be quick to remove ourselves to non-believes but instead invite them to participate and know Jesus.
Jesus himself came and died for us while we were still in sin. Let us show that same grace to unbelievers each day.

16. God's Dwelling Place (2 Chronicles 3: 1-17)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181029

Today, we will be taken to Jerusalem and see where they built the first temple, Solomon's temple.
Location, is what we'll be studying. Mount Moriah, is where Solomon built his temple.
Mt Moriah is also where Abraham was about to sacrifice his own son for God.
This location is a threshing floor, its a place for seperation.
The bible is about calling and choosing his people. Unfortunately there will be a time where God seperates the people of the world.
We want to work hard so more people will come to know Christ.
God continually give's Solomon precise directions, cubits.
We cannot wing it with God, we need to follow God specifically within our lives and ministry.
Everything in that temple was overlayed with Gold, They didn't spare any expense and they gave everything they had.
When we give to God we dont give him our left overs we give him our best.
Remember Location, Location, Location, they built the temple in a special place where the most people will be reached.
Where we serve is also important, if we're in ministry (children, youth, em, adult etc)

How do you express God's glory through your life?
In the old testament we read about Solomon and the temple,
In the new testament we "are the temple of the Holy Spirit".
	-we are vessals of gold in God's temple.

When we pray we should ask God where we should serve.

17. Temple's Furnishings (2 Chronicles 4:1 - 5:1)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181030

Solomon and his people just finished creating the temple, but it was just a shell. In this lesson, we're going to see the furniture Solomon put in his temple.
It is important what we put inside our home/ furniture. 
Today's QT is about the temple's furnishing.
Alot of people put TV's in their house, the wives would put kitchenware, the furnishings in someone's house really tells alot about the persons.
The first furnishing was the Alter of Bronze. -It's the place of sacrafice, There is no connection with God, no bridge with God unless their is sacrafice.
	- The Sacrafice of Jesus is the application for us, that is where our relationship begins with God.
The washing basin was the next furniture. -Was a place to wash themselves when people came to worship.
	- For us, it represents baptism. It represents the cleansing of the word, the cleansing of repentence.
10 Golden lamp stands -Illumination for worshippers in the temple.
	- The lamp stands represents the word of God. It lights our path and tells us where to go.
	- We need the Illumination everyday. That is God's words.
The next furnishings were the tables, 10 tables - and it had bread. Bread represents the mana from heaven.
	- The bread represents the things we need in life, Jesus said that I am the bread of life. That bread represents Spiritual food.
	- When we eat that bread we have that communion with our Father.

At the end when they were finished furnishing the temple, all the furnishings that David had prepared, Solomon was carrying out his dad's wishes.

How much priority do you place on prayer, fellowship, and Bible study?

When we are outside the temple, its all about sacrafice, its all about washing
As you entered into the temple, it's all about communion, between the priest and God.
We need to prepare our hearts but also we need to spend time in communion with the Father.

"No one can advance three paces on the road to perfection unless Jesus Christ walks beside him". -Robert Hugh Benson.

18. The Glory of the LORD (2 Chronicles 5:2-14)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181031

The glory of God is not a feeling, its not an emotion. You can see it, it's real
Is God's glory real in your life?
Leadership, Solomon got all the leadership on board, he got all the rulers and leaders to do this thing.
 - Step 1, is to get the leaders on board with our churches.
 - We cant give what we dont have as leaders. The leaders in the church must be spiritual people with annointing.
The ark of the covenant had to be brought to the temple of solomon, the levite priests brought the ark "the right way", not like before where oxens/bulls were dragging it.
	- We need to do things the right way, 
The third thing was sacrafice.
	- They sacrafice so many sheep that they couldn't keep count.
	- The church cannot accomplish it's mission, without the sacrafice of Jesus. The gospel of Jesus Christ that he was the ultimate sacrafice.
They brought the ark and placed it in the holy of holies, under the wings of the cheribums. The tablets were in the ark of the covenant.
Then they worshipped, They had a 120 people blowing trumpets and worshipped.
After the sacrafice, after doing things the right way, the final thing was God's approval.
	- His presence came into the temple and they couldn't see. They were nearly blinded by his presence.

What are some indicators of God's presence and favor in your life?
	- When the ark of the covenant was fullfilled it was the mark of end of slavery, the end of egypt
	- How do you know if God's presence is real in our lives?
	- Is there peace, love, gentleness, do we have self control? Those are some of the proof that God's presence exist in our lives.

"He who sees the infinite in all things, sees God". -William Blake

19. God Remembers (2 Chronicles 6:1-11)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181101

God makes and keeps his promise.
Chronicles is a book of history, Solomon was the one who built the temple.
God was in a dark cloud, the dark cloud was God's presence. The dark cloud will have a permament home within Saul's temple.
God chose Jerusalem as his place to dwell. 
We see that our God, is a God who keeps his promise. He said that Solomon will build the temple, and Solomon did build the temple.
We think of Jesus who will be the ultimate ruler, The king of kings and the Lord of lords.
Jesus is the temple, God resides in the temple within our hearts through Jesus.

How can you continue to trust God even when your life does not go as you planned?
God is compassionate, forgiving, loving, healer, and our peace.
He is a God who remembers us, and never forgets us.
He sits high and above creation, he remember the state of his creation.
He remembered us, he made a promise to David, and it was fulfilled through Solomon.
Through that line, that promise was fulfilled with Jesus Christ, Jesus is still fullfilling that promise.
He is showing love, compassion, and mercy of God.
Do we know that love and forgiveness and compassion of God?
When Jesus was on the cross he remembered us. Today is another opportunity to get to know him.
He does not desire that anyone would perish but all to come to repentance.

"I am Thy servant to do Thy will, and taht will is sweeter to me than position or riches or fame and I choose it above all things on earth or in heaven". - A.W. Tozer

20. Great Intercessory Prayer (2 Chronicles 6:12-42)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181102

Solomon was trying to make the temple central/ the focal point of all jewish and israelite life.
One would pay in the temple for various situations or pray to the temple that God would act on that prayer.
Even with Daniel
Daniel went back up to his room and he opened the window and prayed towards the temple.
The temple should be the place where God wrongs/judges the israelites.
Another thing Solomon was praying for was that God forgives the people if they go in to battle.
He also prays that God forgives the nation if there is drought or disease.
He was praying in anticipation that when the Israelites sin even before.
Using the temple as a central focal point since God's presence was there.
He wanted to pray for the Foreigners/Gentiles to seek God.
He also finally said that the people will be blessed in times of battle.
God is a covenant keeping and loyal to the people of Israel, and thats why God should hear Solomons prayer and act accordingly.

How can you have stronger conviction and speak with greater faith when you pray?
God was a covenant keeping God, he was faithful to david and to the dynasty after. and all the way to the line to Jesus.
Do we know the promise keeping God? Today is our day to know him, we should seek him and seek peace for all eternity.

"I could no more doubt the efficacy of prayer than I could disbelieve in the law of gravitation". -Charles Spurgeon.

21. God Resides with Us (2 Chronicles 7:1-10)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181103

After Solomon finished his prayer, God approved by coming down as fire in the temple.
The glory of God fills the temple, the priest could not even enter the temple.
This was enjoyed by the whole Israelite community, they came to participate, the temple was full of sheep and bulls.
22,000 cattle 120,000 sheeps and goats - Solomon had a prepare a special area of the temple to sacrafice the animals.
After the sacrafice was finished the people was able to eat the remainder. It was a time for feast.
God comes down, glory fills the temple, his presence is there, now that he has a permanent home.
Jesus gave us a permanent home when he came into our lives and now we are a part of the kingdom of God.

How can you praise God for his enduring love and goodness throughout the day?
Are we living in this life without Jesus, Have we not been adopted by the family of God?
We should invite Jesus into our lives.

"In commanding us to glorify him, God is inviting us to enjoy him". - C. S. Lewis.

22. God Resides with Us (2 Chronicles 7:11-22)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181104

In this particular passage we will see Solomon's prayer of dedication of the temple, actually took 13 years for God to answer.
2 Chronicles chapter 6 vs 12-42 Do we remember what Solomon prayed?
Solomon prayed 13 years before, God answered his prayer. 
Sometimes it may seem God may not answer us/hear us. But the bible clearly says, that...
God answers our prayers based upon our relationship with him.
If we ask anything according to his will, he hears us. and if we know he knows he hears us, then we know we have what we have what we asked of him.
Solomon prayed 13 years before and God finally answered his prayer about the Israelites and sin.
The word "hear" in the jewish sense is not just audible hearing but it also implies that God will "act on their behalf". He said he will forgive their sins and he will heal their lands.
This "hear" is not applicable to just the jews, it's applicable to everyone who believes in Jesus Christ.
We are called by God, to walk upright with him. We have the opportunity to walk upright with God through Jesus Christ.

If we repent, and seek God's forgiveness and seek his face, and turn from our wicked ways, he will Hear from heaven, He will forgive our sins, and he will Heal our land.

How can you reconcile God's judgement with his love?
	- Be encouraged God is near, he is still in the forgiveness business, the healing business.
	- Whatever anxiety and problem we have, take it to the Lord. He is still in the forgiving/healing business.

23. Expanding God's Kingdom (2 Chronicles 8:1-16)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181105

Today we see the two aspects of Solomon, his power and his worship to God.
Seperation of our secular and spirituality. "Sundays revival and mondays I cant even find my bible"
1-11 (Solomon's power)
11-16 (Solomon's Worship)
In the Old testament, there is no distinction between the secular and sacred.
Psalms - my time is in Your hands. God has a hand in every season in our lives.
We shouldn't read the passage today linearly but read as a whole. 
His success as a king was totally dependant/as important/ as powerful to his worship.

How do you worship God outside of the four walls of your church?
	- We need to merge out the secular and sacred ways of our lives.
	- The mentality of how we live, the way we consider our work.
	- The sacred and the secular, we need to embrace both and apply both whenever or wherever we are doing.

"The secret to freedom from enslaving patterns of sin is worship. You need worship. You need great worship. You need weeping worship. You need glorious worship. You need to sense God's greatness and to be moved by it". - Tim Keller

24. Wealth and Wisdom (2 Chronicles 8:17-9:12)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181106

Chapter 8 is about power and worship of God by Solomon.
Chapter 9 is about wealth and wisdom by Solomon.
God is the source of wisdom and wealth Solomon owns/has.
The impression on the queen Sheiba is the power belongs to the people of God, The people who do not know God, and do not acknowledge God know this.
One soverign King, with one soverign Queen. The Queen probably travelled weeks/months, with gifts and fortune. (this was business not pleasure..)
Solomon's way of ruling impressed her the queen. Everything Solomon said impressed the queen.
Solomon made his spirituality the pride of his achievements. That is the center and the root of the passage today.
Vs 8 - the queen talks your God, she learns about the Lord - Solomon's God.
The queen saw and heard about God, from Solomon. 
	- God must be exalted in our personal relationship.
	- God must be exalted in our personal dealings/ in our work. 
	- We shouldn't hide God from our relationships. We should not be embarassed.
We need to think hard about our salvation, esp, this day and age, the truth of God is being attacked
	- from media and all walks of life, the gospel is under attack and we need to take pride in our God.
	- The bible has already warned us, about this culture attacking us.

When were you last awestruck by God's great wisdom and the riches of His glory?
	- How can you live portraying and revealing Christ, preaching the gospel in our workplace and in our works. (lovingly and not judgingly..)

25. The Greater Solomon (2 Chronicles 9:13-31)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181107

We are the children of a God who has everything, who own's everything.
chapter 8 talks about his power, and worship
chapter 9 talks about talks about his wealth and wisdom.
verses 15-20 talks about the bounty of the kingdom.
A 2 word summary of the book of revalations is "God wins"
2 word summary of today's passage. "God owns". 
Solomon asked for wisdom and knowledge to rule God's people. Since he didnt ask for materialistic things God gave him more than what he asked for.
"People of yours" - Solomon is reconognizing that the people are not his, but God's people.
But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. - Matthew 6:33
	- Seek first "God's Kingdom", seek first "God". We need to first seek God before anything else.
King Solomon had the wealth and wisdom because God granted it to him. Solomon seeked first God.

How does God's faithfulness inspire you to overcome sin and pursue righteousness?
	- Lets not imagine what the kingdom of God looks like, but instead seek God.

"The only monarch who ever deserved that man should fall down before him was a child of poverty, whose life was spent in teaching, and who died on ignominious death". -Martin Luther

26. Solomon's Successor (2 Chronicles 10:1-11)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181108

"Be the bigger man", steering clear of your father's mistakes/sins. learning from our father's mistakes.
King Rehoboam is facing a situation, he had an opportunity to learn from his father's mistake.
The first group is elders that served during Solomon's time, and the young men that served Rehoboam.
The first group is tied to the father, and the second is tied to Rehoboam himself. He rejected the elders, and he went with his young men's advice.
He rejected his father, and went with his advisors.
Any negative factors are traced back to the home and lack of a father. 
Ephesians 6: Children obey your parents in the Lord for this is right, honor your mother and father, that you may live long in the land. Fathers, Bring them up in the discipline in the Lord.
Children, we are called by God to obey our parents. We build upon their strengths and we grow even bigger.
Rehoboam in the way he rejects his father is the nail in the coffin of Israel.

What leadership lessons have you learned from God's word?

Today's passage is a reminder to obey and to honor, and to raise our children with discipline in the way of our Lord.
Gospel centered/ Christ centered relationships.
Seek the father in heaven to pray for our parents, pray for their soul, honor them.

"The very first thing which needs to be said about Christian ministers of all kinds is that they are 'under' people as their servants rather than 'over' them (as their leaders, let alone their lords). Jesus made this absolutely plain". -John Stott.

26. Choice and Consequence (2 Chronicles 10:12-19)
http://www.cgntv.net/legacy/player.cgn?pid=25&skin=duranno&vday=20181109

We see a man named Rehoboam, he made a foolish choice from an obvious choice.
At first glance it was a foolish decision, but at the second glance we see it more foolish.
Rehoboam is acquiring the kingdom of Solomon, he made decisions of his peers, and people around his age.
Rehoboam is not in his teens, he is about 40-41 years old. And yet he makes a very interesting decision.
He is inheriting his kingship, the end of Solomon is where everything is going downhill.
Financially the kingdom is going downhill, there are enemies that are actively attacking the people of God.
Rehoboam made an interesting decision, he consulted the elders first, then his peers.
In the scriptures we read, respect your elders. Rehoboam is looking at the legacy of his father.
Rehoboam is probably looking at the elders and assumes because of the elders the kingdom is in a downhill.
The reason why at first and second glance, Rehoboam is foolish, is because we see a difference with Rehoboam and David in kingship.
When David and Solomon became king they both sought out God. Rehoboam doesn't see the counsel of God but he seeks men's counsel.
What we see is a foolish man who does not seek God or God's wisdom.

Ask God to draw you toward those who challenge you with their wisdom and point you toward His ways.

if we look back to history every king fails to serve the people.
Only one king serves all man kind and we see that king in the new testament, his name is Jesus.
Mark chapter 10, even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve and to give his life of a ransom for many.
The failure of Rehoboam points to the true king, Jesus.

"There is nothing more foolish than an act of wickedness; there is no wisdom equal to that of obeying God". -Albert Barnes
